In inferential statistics we need a model what we infer, and determining the right model is a crucial point. Which is why the initial part of it is an explorative analysis of the data, where we summarize and describe the sample, giving us a better idea of it's shape and size.
In general the following are used to describe and summarize samples of one or two variables:
- Measures of centrality:
	- [[Mean]] $\mu$
		- If the mean is computed on the sample, it's called the *sample mean* and is denoted: $\tilde{\mu}$
	- [[Median]]
	- [[Quantiles and percentiles]]
- Measures of "spread":
	- [[Variance]]
	- [[Standard deviation]]
	- [[Coefficient of variation]]
	- [[Inter Quartile Range - IQR]]
- Measures of relation between two variables:
	- [[Covariance]]
	- [[Correlation]]
