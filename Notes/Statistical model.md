In all statistical analysis there must be an assumption of a model, which should be clearly stated in the presentation of the analysis.
Example: Model expressing that the samples were taken randomly from a [[Normal distribution|normally distributed ]] population, and that each samples independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) is written as:
$$
X_{i} \sim N\left(\mu, \sigma^{2}\right) \text { and i.i.d., where } i=1, \ldots, n \text {. }
$$
