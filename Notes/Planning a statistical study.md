An important part of planning a study is determining the [[Sample size calculation]]. Making the size unnecessarily large can have unwanted effects such as economical and unnecessary harm.
However a too small sample size will result in the same, if the study turns out to be inconclusive.

When planning there's 5 parameters we need to decide:
- [[Sample size calculation|Sample size]] $n$
- [[Statistical significance|Significance level]] $\alpha$ of the test.
- A change in mean that you would want to detect (effect size) $\mu_{0}-\mu_{1}$.
- The population [[standard deviation]], $\sigma$.
- The [[Statistical power]] $(1-\beta)=P\left(\right.$ Reject $H_{0}$ when $H_{1}$ is true).
