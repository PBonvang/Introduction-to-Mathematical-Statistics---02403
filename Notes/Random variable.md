A random variable is a function assigning a numerical value to each outcome in the sample space.
Often denoted as capital letters, e.g. $X,Y$

An example of a random variable is a coin toss, where head is assigned 0 and tail 1. In that way the outcome of the "experiment" is assigned a numerical value.
Note that the assignment is done prior to the experiment.

A random variable always has a [[Probability density function - PDF]] associated with it, describing the probability of each outcome.
