A sample denoted with small letters: $x,y,z$
Concrete observations of random variables are denoted with small letters: $x_{1},x_{2}\mid y_{1},y_{2}\mid z_{1},z_{2}$

Sample parameters are denoted with a hat or a bar:
- [[Sample mean]]: 
	- Random variable/Estimator: $\bar{X}$
	- Estimate: $\bar{x},\hat{\mu}$
- [[Sample variance]]:
	- Random variable/Estimator: $S^{2}$
	- Estimate: $s^{2},\bar{\sigma}^{2}$
