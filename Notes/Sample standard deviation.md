$$s=\hat{\sigma}=\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}-\mu\right)^{2}}$$
$\hat{\sigma}:$ [[Variance#Sample variance|sample variance]]
$\mu:$ [[Mean]]

The reason we divide with $n-1$, is that $\tilde{\mu}$ isn't the real mean and therefore the difference is slightly lower than the difference with the actual mean $\mu$, and it turns out we can correct this is to subtract one from the denominator.
