The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic which is at least as extreme as the observed test statistic. It's generally a measure of how probable it is to observe the observed test statistic, used to determine how likely it is that a hypotheses is true.
This probability is calculated under the assumption that [[The null hypothesis]] is true.

It's a general measure of evidence against a null hypotheses.

In general: If the $p$-value $<\alpha$ ([[Statistical significance|Significance level]]) we reject $H_{0}$ else we accept it.
