Statistics is the art of making sense of data; learning and extracting the essence of it, to provide a useful and understandable format of the data. For example: Visualization, machine learning, medical trials...
It is a tool which can provide us with answers to complicated question, and provide solutions for complex tasks.

The difference between [[Probability]] and statistics is the mere fact that probability is determined by the theoretical population, where we know the probability of each possible outcome, where as statistics are done on samples of a population.
