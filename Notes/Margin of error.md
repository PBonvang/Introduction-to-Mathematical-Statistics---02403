$$ME=e=z_{1-\alpha/2}\cdot\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$
$z_{1-\alpha/2}:$ [[Critical values|Critical value]] from the [[Standard normal distribution]] with significance level $\alpha$.
$\hat{p}:$ The estimated proportion
$n:$ Sample size

Margin of error determines the range of a [[Confidence interval]] and is often a variable determined without calculation. Say if you wish to know the probability of winning the lottery with a $\pm$ 1% certainty the margin of error should be $e=0.01/2=0.005$.
