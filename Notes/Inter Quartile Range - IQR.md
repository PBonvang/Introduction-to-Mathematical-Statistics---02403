$$\large
I Q R=q_{0.75}-q_{0.25}=Q_{3}-Q_{1}
$$

The inter Quartile Range (IQR) describes the middle 50% range of the data.
It essentially gives a measure of the variance of the middle 50% of the sorted data.

**Example:** A dataset consisting of peoples height
If $\op{IQR}=20cm$: 50% of the peoples height lie withing 20cm of each other.
