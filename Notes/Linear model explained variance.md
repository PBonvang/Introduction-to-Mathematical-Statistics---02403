$$\frac{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{p}\op{Var}(\beta_{i})}{\sum\limits_{i=0}^{p}\op{Var}(\beta_{i}) + \op{Var}(e)}$$
$\beta:$ Model parameters
$e:$ Residuals/Errors

Explained variance of a model, is a measure of the variance in the data explained by the parameters in the model, essentially the level to which the model can model the data. If the explained variance is low the model doesn't fit the data well, opposite for high explained variance.
For most [[linear regression]] models the explained variance is computed as the [[Coefficient of determination]].
