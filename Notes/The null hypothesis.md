<center>Null hypothesis distribution for 95%</center>

The null hypothesis is assuming that there's no effect or no difference and is what we must assume before seeing any evidence suggesting otherwise.
It's therefore the first check done before studying the degree of effect.
It must be falsifiable, meaning that it should be possible to collect evidence against it.
