$$\large
\alpha = 1-\text{"The wanted level of certainty"}
$$
In statistics if we say that an effect is significant, it means that the [[p-value]] is so low that the null hypotheses has been rejected at some significance level $\alpha$.
The significance level is a level of certainty, it's what allows us to say that we are $x$% certain that something is true.
E.g. the 99% certainty significance level:
$$\alpha=1-0.99=0.01$$

Common significance levels: 0.05 (95%), 0.01 (99%) and 0.001 (99.9%), with 0.05 being the default.
